//Overriding Methods

//If a subclass declares a method that has the same signature as a public method of
//the base class, the subclass version of the method overrides the base class version
//of the method. This technique lets you modify the behavior of a base class to suit
//the needs of the subclass.

//Suppose you have a base class named Game that has a method named play. The
//base class, which doesnâ€™t represent any particular game, implements this method:

public class Game {

    public void play() {
    }
}
