//Final Methods

//public class SpaceShip {
//
//    public final int getVelocity() {
//        return this.velocity;
//    }
//}

//Here the method getVelocity is declared as final. Thus, any class that uses the
//SpaceShip class as a base class can’t override the getVelocity method. If it tries,
//the compiler issues the error message ("Overridden method final").


//Final Classes

//A final class is a class that can’t be used as a base class. To declare a class as final,
//just add the final keyword to the class declaration:

//public final class BaseBall {
//// members for the BaseBall class go here
//}

//Then no one can use the BaseBall class as the base class for another class.
