//Hereâ€™s a class that implements the Playable interface:

public class TicTacToe implements Playable {
// additional fields and methods go here

    public void play() {
// code that plays the game goes here
    }
// additional fields and methods go here
}


//Here the declaration for the TicTacToe class specifies implements Playable.
//Then the body of the class includes an implementation of the play method.
