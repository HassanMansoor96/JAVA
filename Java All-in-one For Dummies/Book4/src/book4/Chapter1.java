//Working with Strings

//Strings are among the most common types of objects in Java.

//Strings are reference types, not value types, such as int or boolean. As a
//result, a string variable holds a reference to an object created from the
//String class, not the value of the string itself.

//Even though strings arenâ€™t primitive types, the Java compiler has some
//features designed to let you work with strings almost as though they were
//primitive types. Java lets you assign string literals to string variables, for
//example, like this:
//String line1 = "Oh what a beautiful morning!";

//Strings can include escape sequences that consist of a slash followed by
//another character. The most common escape sequences are \n for new line
//and \t for tab. If you want to include a back slash in a string, you must use the
//escape sequence \\. Here is a complete list of all the escape sequences you
//can use:

//Escape Sequence Explanation
//\n Newline
//\t Tab
//\b Backspace
//\r Carriage return
//\f Form feed
//\' Apostrophe
//\" Quotation mark
//\\ Back slash

//Strings and characters are different. String literals are marked by quotation
//marks; character literals are marked by apostrophes. Thus, "a" is a string
//literal that happens to be one character long. By contrast, 'a' is a character
//literal.
