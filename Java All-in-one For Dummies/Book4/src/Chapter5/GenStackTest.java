/*
This program creates a GenStack object that can hold String objects. It then
pushes four strings onto the stack and prints the number of items in the stack.
Next, it uses the peek method to print the top item and again prints the number of
items in the stack, just to make sure the peek method doesnâ€™t accidentally remove
the item. Next, it uses a while loop to pop each item off the stack and print it.
Then, once again, it prints the number of items, and it peeks at the top item.
