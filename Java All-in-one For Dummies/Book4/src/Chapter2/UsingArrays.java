//Understanding Arrays

//An array is a set of variables that is referenced by using a single variable name
//combined with an index number. Each item of an array is called an element. All
//the elements in an array must be of the same type. Thus the array itself has a type
//that specifies what kind of elements it can contain. An int array can contain int
//values, for example, and a String array can contain strings
