//Using Two-Dimensional Arrays

//The elements of an array can be any type of object you want, including another
//array. In the latter case, you have a two-dimensional array, sometimes called an
//array of arrays.

//Two-dimensional arrays are often used to track data in column-and-row format,
//much the way that a spreadsheet works


//Creating a two-dimensional array

//To declare a two-dimensional array for this sales data, you simply list two sets of
//empty brackets, like this:

//double sales[][];

//Here sales is a two-dimensional array of type double. To put it another way,
//sales is an array of double arrays.

//To create the array, you use the new keyword and provide lengths for each set of
//brackets, as in this example:

//sales = new double[5][4];

//Here the first dimension specifies that the sales array has five elements. This
//array represents the rows in the table. The second dimension specifies that each
//of those elements has an array of type double with four elements. This array represents
//the columns in the table.

//Note that as with a one-dimensional array, you can declare and create a twodimensional
//array in one statement, like this:

//double[][] sales = new double[5][4];

//Here the sales array is declared and created all in one statement.
