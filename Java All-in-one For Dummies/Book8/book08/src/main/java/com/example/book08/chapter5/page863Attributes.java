Attributes
Instead of using child elements, you can use attributes to provide data for an
element.
An attribute is a name-and-value pair that’s written inside the start tag
for an element. Here’s a Movie element that uses an attribute instead of a child
element to record the year:

<Movie year="1946">
<Title>It's a Wonderful Life</Title>
<Price>14.95</Price>
</Movie>

Whether you use attributes or child elements is largely a matter of personal preference.
Many XML purists say that you should avoid using attributes or use them only to 
identify data such as identification numbers or codes; others suggest using
attributes freely. In my experience, a few attributes here and there don’t hurt, but
for the most part I avoid using them.
